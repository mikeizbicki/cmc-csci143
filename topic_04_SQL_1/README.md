# Topic 04: Basic SQL

## Announcements

1. We're about 1 week behind previous classes
    1. due to extra focus on bash/git/lambda server
    1. still on a good pace
    1. probably lecture this Friday

1. Assignments:
    1. Extend flask-on-docker due date to Sunday (19 Feb)
    1. No late penalty applied to `lab_02_docker` (everyone got 4/4)
    1. (Almost) No more docker weirdness!!!
    1. THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSIONS FOR THE NEXT HOMEWORK ON SQL!

1. Outline of the rest of the class:
    1. 3 weeks: how to make SQL correct
        - 3 hw
        - midterm (SQL only, no docker)
    1. 6 weeks: how to make SQL (and other things) fast

## Lecture

Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMSs):

1. It doesn't matter what the problem is, a database is the solution

1. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language for accessing the database
    1. don't pronounce it es-cue-el; that's a shibboleth for not being a databases person

    1. SQL was originally SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), but shortened due to trademark reasons
        1. You can find the official ANSI SQL standards and history at https://blog.ansi.org/2018/10/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2016-ansi-x3-135/
        1. Invented in the 70s (just like the POSIX-shell), and so has lots of weird warts for backwards-compatibility reasons
    1. Comparison to other languages:
        1. Imperative languages (e.g. Python/C/C++/Java/etc) specify **how** to compute 
        1. Declarative languages (e.g. SQL/Prolog) specify **what** to compute.
           A compiler will convert the declarative code into imperative code.
           The resulting code has provably guaranteed excellent performance (both asymptotically and constant factors).
    1. Object Relational Mappers (ORMs):
        1. Libraries that "hide" the SQL interface to the database
        1. Make it so that you don't have to learn SQL, and can rely on your "normal" imperative programming knowledge
        1. They're easy to get started with, but much harder once you need to scale
            1. reddit uses the SQLAlchemy ORM
            1. twitter started with Ruby on Rails, but left due to bad performance
        1. [What ORMs have taught me: Just learn SQL](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24845300)

1. There are two other categories of databases:
    1. NoSQL databases (MongoDB, CassandraDB, etc.)
        1. No standard language for accessing them
        1. No guarantees that the data will actually be in the database
    1. Graph databases
        1. Use SparQL instead of SQL

1. Comparison of main database systems:
    1. <http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/>
    1. [database popularity from stackoverflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-databases)
    1. my summary:
        1. if you can't install docker (e.g. writing a cell phone app), use sqlite3 
        1. otherwise, use postgresql
    1. [Even Microsoft uses Postgres instead of SQLServer for large scale database needs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-postgresql/architecting-petabyte-scale-analytics-by-scaling-out-postgres-on/ba-p/969685)

What you must know for the homework/midterm

1. midterm questions will be the sorts of SQL questions found in data science technical interviews

1. `SELECT`
    1. sections 1,2,4 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. aggregate functions `count`, `max`, `min`, `sum`, `avg`
    1. never use the `BETWEEN` keyword: <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_BETWEEN_.28especially_with_timestamps.29>

1. `JOIN`
    1. section 3 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. for this homework, you will only need inner joins; next homework will need all types of joins
    <!--
    1. the "standard" explanation of joins uses venn diagrams, but this is technically not correct since relations are not sets; see: https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/
    1. joins memes

1. weird syntax
    1. whitespace doesn't matter, every command must end in a semicolon
    1. case insensitive
    1. `'` is for quoting literals, `"` is for quoting table/column names
    1. escape quotes by doubling them, not a backslash `'isn''t'` not `'isn\'t'`
    1. dollar sign quotes
        1. `$$this is a quote$$` is equivalent to `'this is a quote'`
        1. useful to avoid having to escape quotes in complex strings: you can write `$$isn't$$` instead of `'isn''t'`
        1. you can "name" the quotation marker: `$blah$isn't$blah$` instead of `$$isn't$$`
    1. concatenate strings with `||` not `+`
