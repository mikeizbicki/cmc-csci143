# Topic 05: SQL II

## Announcements

1. I forgot to mention when we covered the glob:
    1. A Pixar employee accidentally deleted Toy Story 2 by a bad `*` operator
    1. They only recovered portions of the movie because a dev was on parental leave and had "accidentally" taken some work home with them
    1. Details: <https://thenextweb.com/news/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good>

1. Friday:
    1. No lab assignment
    1. Finish up whatever we don't cover today (will be recorded)
    1. The rest of the time available to work

1. Get a good workflow going for your assignments

## Lecture

What you must know for the homework/midterm/quiz

1. skipping section 6 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. syntactic sugar for complicated GROUP BY clauses
    1. good to know, but they're not "hard" concepts
    1. "less technical" technical interviews often ask about these topics

1. subqueries
    1. section 7 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
    1. compared to joins (power):
        1. every join can be written as a cross join + subquery
        1. some subqueries can be written as joins
        1. a subquery cannot be written as a join if it contains an aggregate function
    1. compared to joins (general):
        1. subqueries are easier for beginners to understand than joins
        1. joins are easier for experts to understand
        1. which is faster depends
    1. alternative reference on subqueries vs joins: https://learnsql.com/blog/subquery-vs-join/

1. set operations
    1. section 5 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
    1. most important operation is `union` vs `union all`

1. joins
    1. sections 3 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
    1. the "standard" explanation of joins uses venn diagrams, but this is technically not correct since relations are not sets; see: https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/

    1. if this all seems weird/hard/confusing... that's because it is

1. arrays
    1. postgresql specific extension, not on quiz
    1. a "denormalized" method for storing join tables
        1. there's speed/memory tradeoffs between different representations which we'll talk about later
        1. for now, just focus on using arrays to get the right answer
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-array/
    1. `unnest` is the only array function you'll want to use (for this week's homework)

<!--
1. `CREATE TABLE`
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-create-table/
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-data-types/
    1. Examples in the tutorial use `VARCHAR`, but you shouldn't use this type in postgresql.
       Instead, you should use the `TEXT` type.
       See: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_varchar.28n.29_by_default

1. `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`
